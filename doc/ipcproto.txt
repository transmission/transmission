It is assumed the reader is familiar with bencoding, as described in
the BitTorrent protocol specification at
http://www.bittorrent.org/protocol.html

Dictionary keys used below will be enclosed in quotation marks, these
are used for clarity and are not part of the actual key.

The IPC protocol is used to allow processes to control or retrieve
information from Transmission frontend, such as transmission-daemon,
transmission-gtk or the MacOS X frontend. This communication is done
over a unix-domain socket file such as
~/.transmission/daemon/socket. In this document the Transmission
frontend will be referred to as the server and the process connecting
to it as the client.

Once a client connects to the server's socket, messages may be
exchanged until either end closes the connection. Messages contain an
32-bit payload length, encoded as 8 bytes of ASCII hexidecimal,
followed by the payload. Upper, lower, or mixed case for the length
are all accpetable and must be handled correctly. Payload lengths
greater than 2^31 - 8 (ie: 2147483640 decimal, 7FFFFFF8 hex) are not
allowed.

Bencoded messages will additionally be shown in the following format
for better readability:
str  - "this is a string"
num  - 38795
list - ("wheeee", 435, "writing docs is boring")
dict - {"name": "Josh", "beverage": "coffee", "quantity": "too damn much" }

For version 1, the message payload is a bencoded dictionary, the
valid keys and value formats for which are described below. Multiple
keys may be used in one message.

An example version 1 message:

0000000Ed4:porti9090ee
        {"port": 9090}

For version 2 the message payload is a bencoded list containing a
message id string followed by a bencoded value, the format of which is
the same for version 1. The value may be followed by an optional
bencoded integer, this is a message tag and is described in more
detail below.

An example version 2 message:

0000001El12:get-info-alll4:hashee
        ("get-info-all", ("hash"))

The same message with a tag:

00000021l12:get-info-alll4:hashei5ee
        ("get-info-all", ("hash"), 5)

Once the connection is made both the client and server must send a
version 1 style message (ie: the payload is a dictionary and may not
contain a tag) with the dictionary key "version" and a value formatted
as described below. The version should be the first but not
necessarily only key in the dictionary. Any other keys should be
ignored and not processed as messages. Neither the client nor the
server should wait to receive a version message before sending one, it
must be sent immediately. No other messages should be sent until the
version is received.

The version value should be a bencoded dictionary containing two keys,
"max" and "min". These are the minimum and maximum supported protocol
versions, respectively. Communication will take place using the
highest protocol version supported by both the client and the server,
and is not possible at all if there is no common version. A client may
receive a version value that is an integer instead of a dictionary
with "min" and "max" keys. This deprecated version format indicates
the only version supported by the server.

The version dictionary may optionally contain a key "label". This is a
human-readable name for the software, it is not machine-readable and
neither servers nor clients should attempt to parse it.

An example message containing minimum and maximum versions 1 and 2:

0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee
        {"version": {"min": 1, "max": 2}}

Tagged messages, only supported in version 2, allow a client to tag a
message with a positive non-zero integer. The server is then required
to send a response to the message even if none would normally be
required, and to tag the response with the same integer. When the
server receives a tagged message it must send exactly one message back
with the same tag. The client is allowed to use the same tag for
multiple messages, even if a response to the first is not received
before the second it sent. If a tagged message does not normally
require a response then a "succeeded", "failed", "not-supported" or
"bad-format" message will be sent back.

An example tagged message and response:

00000010l5:startli8eei15ee
        ("start", (8), 15)
00000011l8:succeeded0:i15ee
        ("succeeded", "", 15)

Some example sessions, including version handshake, are found at the
end of this file.

Dictionary keys are encoded in UTF-8 and case sensitive. Any character
except a NUL (0x00) is valid. A server or client need not support
every possible key and should silently ignore any that it does not
understand.

If a reference to a boolean is seen, it should be taken to mean an
integer with a value of 0 representing false, 1 representing true, and
any other value undefined.

Individual torrents are identified by a unique integer. This integer
is only valid for the current connection and may be invalid or refer
to another torrent in a future connection. If a torrent is closed it's
ID will never be reused to refer to another torrent for at least the
duration of the connection. Negative integers or 0 are not valid IDs.

A list of keys and the format of their values follows. Also listed is
the minimum protocol version that the key may be used with.

Examples:

Data from the client to the server is prefixed with >>> and from
server to client with <<<. These prefixes and newlines are added for
clarity, they are not actually sent over the socket.

Quit the server. Note that this is a version 1 client and so version 1
messages are used.
>>> 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi1eee
            {"version", {"min": 1, "max": 1"}}

>>> 0000000Bd4:quit0:e
            {"quit": ""}

Pause all torrents and disable automapping. Note the server happens to
have sent it's version before the client. The value for the stop-all
message here is 5:fnord instead of 0: as used above, since the value
is unused anything is allowed.
<<< 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee
            {"version", {"min": 1, "max": 2"}}
>>> 0000001Dd7:versiond3:mini1e3:maxi2eee
