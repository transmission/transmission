1.  Introduction

   This document describes a protocol for interacting with Transmission
   sessions remotely.

1.1  Terminology

   The JSON terminology in RFC 4627 is used.

   In benc terms, a JSON "array" is equivalent to a benc list,
   a JSON "object" is equivalent to a benc dictionary,
   and a JSON object's "keys" are the dictionary's string keys.

2.  Message Format

   Messages are formatted as objects.  There are two types:
   requests (described in 2.1) and responses (described in 2.2).

   All text MUST be UTF-8 encoded.

2.1.  Requests

   Requests support three keys:

   (1) A required "method" string telling the name of the method to invoke
   (2) An optional "arguments" object of key/value pairs
   (3) An optional "tag" number used by clients to track responses.
       If provided by a request, the response MUST include the same tag.

2.2.  Responses

   Reponses support three keys:

   (1) A required "result" string whose value MUST be "success" on success,
       or an error string on failure.
   (2) An optional "arguments" object of key/value pairs
   (3) An optional "tag" number as described in 2.1.

2.3.  Transport Mechanism

   HTTP POSTing a JSON-encoded request is the preferred way of communicating
   with a Transmission RPC server.  The current Transmission implementation
   has the default URL as http://host:9091/transmission/rpc.  Clients
   may use this as a default, but should allow the URL to be reconfigured,
   since the port and path may be changed to allow mapping and/or multiple
   daemons to run on a single server.

   In addition to POSTing, there's also a simple notation for sending
   requests in the query portion of a URL.  This is not as robust, but can
   be useful for debugging and simple tasks.  The notation works as follows:

   (1) Any key not "tag" or "method" is treated as an argument.
   (2) The "arguments" key isn't needed, since data isn't nested.
   (3) If the value in a key/value pair can be parsed as a number, then it is.
       Otherwise if it can be parsed as an array of numbers, then it is.
       Otherwise, it's parsed as a string.

   Examples:
   ?method=torrent-start&ids=1,2
   ?method=session-set&speed-limit-down=50&speed-limit-down-enabled=1
   

3.  Torrent Requests

3.1.  Torrent Action Requests

   Method name          | libtransmission function
   ---------------------+-------------------------------------------------
   "torrent-start"      | tr_torrentStart
   "torrent-stop"       | tr_torrentStop
   "torrent-verify"     | tr_torrentVerify
   "torrent-reannounce" | tr_torrentManualUpdate ("ask tracker for more peers")

   Request arguments: "ids", which specifies which torrents to use.
                  All torrents are used if the "ids" argument is omitted.
                  "ids" should be one of the following:
                  (1) an integer referring to a torrent id
                  (2) a list of torrent id numbers, sha1 hash strings, or both
                  (3) a string, "recently-active", for recently-active torrents

   Response arguments: none

3.2.  Torrent Mutators

   Method name: "torrent-set"

   Request arguments:

   string                | value type & description
   ----------------------+-------------------------------------------------
   "bandwidthPriority"   | number     this torrent's bandwidth tr_priority_t
   "downloadLimit"       | number     maximum download speed (in K/s)
   "downloadLimited"     | boolean    true if "downloadLimit" is honored
   "files-wanted"        | array      indices of file(s) to download
   "files-unwanted"      | array      indices of file(s) to not download
   "honorsSessionLimits" | boolean    true if session upload limits are honored
   "ids"                 | array      torrent list, as described in 3.1
   "location"            | string     new location of the torrent's content
   "peer-limit"          | number     maximum number of peers
   "priority-high"       | array      indices of high-priority file(s)
   "priority-low"        | array      indices of low-priority file(s)
   "priority-normal"     | array      indices of normal-priority file(s)
   "seedRatioLimit"      | double     session seeding ratio
   "seedRatioMode"       | number     which ratio to use.  See tr_ratiolimit
   "uploadLimit"         | number     maximum upload speed (in K/s)
   "uploadLimited"       | boolean    true if "uploadLimit" is honored

   Just as an empty "ids" value is shorthand for "all ids", using an empty array
   for "files-wanted", "files-unwanted", "priority-high", "priority-low", or
   "priority-normal" is shorthand for saying "all files".

   Response arguments: none

3.3.  Torrent Accessors

   Method name: "torrent-get".

   Request arguments:

   (1) An opional "ids" array as described in 3.1.
   (2) A required "fields" array of keys. (see list below)

   Response arguments:

   (1) A "torrents" array of objects, each of which contains
       the key/value pairs matching the request's "fields" argument.
   (2) If the request's "ids" field was "recently-active",
       a "removed" array of torrent-id numbers of recently-removed
       torrents.
