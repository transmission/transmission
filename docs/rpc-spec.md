# Transmission's RPC specification
This document describes a protocol for interacting with Transmission sessions remotely.

### 1.1 Terminology
The [JSON](https://www.json.org/) terminology in [RFC 8259](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) is used.
RPC requests and responses are formatted in JSON.

### 1.2 Tools
If `transmission-remote` is called with a `--debug` argument, its RPC traffic to the Transmission server will be dumped to the terminal. This can be useful when you want to compare requests in your application to another for reference.

If `transmission-qt` is run with an environment variable `TR_RPC_VERBOSE` set, it too will dump the RPC requests and responses to the terminal for inspection.

Lastly, using the browser's developer tools in the Transmission web client is always an option.

### 1.3 Libraries of ready-made wrappers
Some people outside of the Transmission project have written libraries that wrap this RPC API. These aren't supported by the Transmission project, but are listed here in the hope that they may be useful:

| Language | Link
|:---|:---
| C# | https://www.nuget.org/packages/Transmission.API.RPC
| Go | https://github.com/hekmon/transmissionrpc
| Python | https://github.com/Trim21/transmission-rpc
| Rust | https://crates.io/crates/transmission-rpc


## 2 Message format
Transmission follows the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification and supports the entirety of it,
except that parameters by-position is not supported, meaning the request parameters must be an Object.

Response parameters are returned in the `result` Object.

#### Example request
```json
{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "params": {
     "fields": [ "version" ]
   },
   "method": "session_get",
   "id": 912313
}
```

#### Example response
```json
{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "result": {
      "version": "4.1.0-dev (ae226418eb)"
   },
   "id": 912313
}
```

### 2.1 Error data

JSON-RPC 2.0 allows for additional information about an error be included in the `data` key of the Error object in an implementation-defined format.

In Transmission, this key is an Object that includes:

1. An optional `errorString` string that provides additional information that is not included in the `message` key of the Error object.
2. An optional `result` Object that contains additional keys defined by the method.

```json
{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "error": {
      "code": 7,
      "message": "HTTP error from backend service",
      "data": {
         "errorString": "Couldn't test port: No Response (0)",
         "result": {
            "ipProtocol": "ipv6"
         }
      }
   },
   "id": 912313
}
```

### 2.2 Transport mechanism
HTTP POSTing a JSON-encoded request is the preferred way of communicating
with a Transmission RPC server. The current Transmission implementation
has the default URL as `http://host:9091/transmission/rpc`. Clients
may use this as a default, but should allow the URL to be reconfigured,
since the port and path may be changed to allow mapping and/or multiple
daemons to run on a single server.

The RPC server will normally return HTTP 200 regardless of whether the
request succeeded. For JSON-RPC 2.0 notifications, HTTP 204 will be returned.

#### 2.2.1 CSRF protection
Most Transmission RPC servers require a `X-Transmission-Session-Id`
header to be sent with requests, to prevent CSRF attacks.

When your request has the wrong id -- such as when you send your first
request, or when the server expires the CSRF token -- the
Transmission RPC server will return an HTTP 409 error with the
right `X-Transmission-Session-Id` in its own headers.

So, the correct way to handle a 409 response is to update your
`X-Transmission-Session-Id` and to resend the previous request.

#### 2.2.2 DNS rebinding protection
Additional check is being made on each RPC request to make sure that the
client sending the request does so using one of the allowed hostnames by
which RPC server is meant to be available.

If host whitelisting is enabled (which is true by default), Transmission
inspects the `Host:` HTTP header value (with port stripped, if any) and
matches it to one of the whitelisted names. Regardless of host whitelist
content, `localhost` and `localhost.` domain names as well as all the IP
addresses are always implicitly allowed.

For more information on configuration, see settings.json documentation for
`rpc-host-whitelist-enabled` and `rpc-host-whitelist` keys.

#### 2.2.3 Authentication
Enabling authentication is an optional security feature that can be enabled
on Transmission RPC servers. Authentication occurs by method of HTTP Basic
Access Authentication.

If authentication is enabled, Transmission inspects the `Authorization:`
HTTP header value to validate the credentials of the request. The value
of this HTTP header is expected to be [`Basic <b64 credentials>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization#basic),
where <b64 credentials> is equal to a base64 encoded string of the
username and password (respectively), separated by a colon.

## 3 Torrent requests
### 3.1 Torrent action requests
| Method name          | libtransmission function | Description
|:--|:--|:--
| `torrent_start`      | tr_torrentStart          | start torrent
| `torrent_start_now`  | tr_torrentStartNow       | start torrent disregarding queue position
| `torrent_stop`       | tr_torrentStop           | stop torrent
| `torrent_verify`     | tr_torrentVerify         | verify torrent
| `torrent_reannounce` | tr_torrentManualUpdate   | re-announce to trackers now

Request parameters: `ids`, which specifies which torrents to use.
All torrents are used if the `ids` parameter is omitted.

`ids` should be one of the following:

1. an integer referring to a torrent id
2. a list of torrent id numbers, SHA1 hash strings, or both
3. a string, `recently_active`, for recently-active torrents

Note that integer torrent ids are not stable across Transmission daemon
restarts. Use torrent hashes if you need stable ids.

Response parameters: none

### 3.2 Torrent mutator: `torrent_set`
Method name: `torrent_set`

Request parameters:

| Key | Value Type | Value Description

| `queue_position`                 | number   | position of this torrent in its queue [0...n)
| `seed_idle_limit`                | number   | torrent-level number of minutes of seeding inactivity
| `seed_idle_mode`                 | number   | which seeding inactivity to use. See tr_idlelimit
| `seed_ratio_limit`               | double   | torrent-level seeding ratio
| `seed_ratio_mode`                | number   | which ratio to use. See tr_ratiolimit
| `sequential_download`            | boolean  | download torrent pieces sequentially
| `sequential_download_from_piece` | number   | download from a specific piece when sequential download is enabled
| `tracker_add`                    | array    | **DEPRECATED** use `tracker_list` instead
| `tracker_list`                   | string   | string of announce URLs, one per line, and a blank line between [tiers](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0012.html).
| `tracker_remove`                 | array    | **DEPRECATED** use `tracker_list` instead

| `upload_limited`                 | boolean  | true if `upload_limit` is honored

Just as an empty `ids` value is shorthand for "all ids", using an empty array
for `files_wanted`, `files_unwanted`, `priority_high`, `priority_low`, or
`priority_normal` is shorthand for saying "all files".

   Response parameters: none

### 3.3 Torrent accessor: `torrent_get`
Method name: `torrent_get`.

Request parameters:

1. An optional `ids` array as described in 3.1.
2. A required `fields` array of keys. (see list below)
3. An optional `format` string specifying how to format the
   `torrents` response field. Allowed values are `objects`
   (default) and `table`. (see "Response parameters" below)

Response parameters:

1. A `torrents` array.

   If the `format` request was `objects` (default), `torrents` will
   be an array of objects, each of which contains the key/value
   pairs matching the request's `fields` arg. This was the only
   format before Transmission 3 and has some obvious programmer
   conveniences, such as parsing directly into Javascript objects.

   If the format was `table`, then `torrents` will be an array of
   arrays. The first row holds the keys and each remaining row holds
   a torrent's values for those keys. This format is more efficient
   in terms of JSON generation and JSON parsing.

2. If the request's `ids` field was `recently_active`,
   a `removed` array of torrent-id numbers of recently-removed
   torrents.

Note: For more information on what these fields mean, see the comments
in [libtransmission/transmission.h](../libtransmission/transmission.h).

Files are returned in the order they are laid out in the torrent. References to "file indices" throughout this specification should be interpreted as the position of the file within this ordering, with the first file bearing index 0.

`file_stats`: a file's non-constant properties. An array of `tr_info.filecount` objects, in the same order as `files`, each containing:

| Key | Value Type | transmission.h source
|:--|:--|:--

`wanted`: An array of `tr_torrentFileCount()` 0/1, 1 (true) if the corresponding file is to be downloaded. (Source: `tr_file_view`)

**Note:** For backwards compatibility, in `4.x.x`, `wanted` is serialized as an array of `0` or `1` that should be treated as booleans.
This will be fixed in `5.0.0` to return an array of booleans.

Example:

Say we want to get the name and total size of torrents #7 and #10.

Request:

```json
{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "params": {
       "fields": [ "id", "name", "total_size" ],
       "ids": [ 7, 10 ]
   },
   "method": "torrent_get",
   "id": 39693
}
```

Response:

```json
{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "result": {
      "torrents": [
         {
             "id": 10,
             "name": "Fedora x86_64 DVD",
             "total_size": 34983493932
         },
         {

             "total_size": 9923890123
         }
      ]
   },
   "id": 39693
}
```

## 5 Protocol versions
This section lists the changes that have been made to the RPC protocol.

There are two ways to check for API compatibility. Since most developers know
[semver](https://semver.org/), `session_get`'s `rpc_version_semver` is the
recommended way. That value is a semver-compatible string of the RPC protocol
version number.

Since Transmission predates the semver 1.0 spec, the previous scheme was for
the RPC version to be a whole number and to increment it whenever a change was
made. That is `session_get`'s `rpc_version`. `rpc_version_minimum` lists the
oldest version that is compatible with the current version; i.e. an app coded
to use `rpc_version_minimum` would still work on a Transmission release running
`rpc_version`.

Breaking changes are denoted with a :bomb: emoji.

Transmission 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 "fixed" this by returning an array of booleans; but in practical terms, this change caused an unannounced breaking change for any 3rd party code that expected `0` or `1`. For this reason, 4.0.2 restored the 3.00 behavior and updated this spec to match the code.
