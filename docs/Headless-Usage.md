# Headless Usage

Transmission can be run in headless mode as a daemon. The daemon, `transmission-daemon`, runs in the background. It communicates with the world via the usual TCP and UDP bittorrent ports, as well as through TCP port 9091. It's on this last port that the daemon accepts commands from `transmission-remote`. These commands are called Remote Procedure Calls, or RPCs. There are RPCs for all of the interactions between a user and a bittorrent client, including adding and removing torrents, displaying global stats, checking torrent download progress, and shutting down the daemon. Each command completes in a finite amount of time and prints the result to stdout.

## Setup

First, the daemon must be started:
```
> mkdir -p ~/.local/log
> transmission-daemon --logfile ~/.local/log/transmission.log
> cat ~/.local/log/transmission.log

```
The daemon forks into the background immediately.

The daemon automatically makes a config file at `.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json`. It can be edited, but the daemon needs to be stopped first, because the daemon automatically overwrites this file when it exits. To stop the daemon:
```
> transmission-remote --exit
localhost:9091/transmission/rpc/ responded: "success"
> 
```

Now, the config file can be edited. Some settings to draw your attention to:
```plain:
~/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
    ...
    # The default download directory.
    "download_dir": "/home/youruser/Downloads",
    ...
    # Reduce the global peer limit if your router is low on memory.
    "peer_limit_global": 32,
    ...
    # For manual port forwarding. This controls the TCP and UDP bittorrent ports.
    "peer_port": 32768,
    ...
    # Reject RPC commands from anybody except localhost. For untrusted LANs.
    "rpc_bind_address": "127.0.0.1",
    ...
    # If there are problems with other internet applications while bittorrent
    # is running, you may need to reduce the max upload speed to under 80% of
    # your ISP's max upload speed.
    "speed_limit_up": 100,  # in KB/s
    "speed_limit_up_enabled": true,
    ...
}
```

Once the daemon is configured to your liking, start it back up.
```
> transmission-daemon --logfile ~/.local/log/transmission.log
> 
```
Headless Transmission is now configured.

## Usage
To add a torrent:
```
> transmission-remote --add 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ff30c7c268f33f35248f05c1c4ffed6752393157&dn=archl
inux-2022.04.05-x86_64.iso'
localhost:9091/transmission/rpc/ responded: "success"
> 
```
To list all torrents:
```
> transmission-remote --list
    ID   Done       Have  ETA           Up    Down  Ratio  Status       Name
     1    41%   359.8 MB  3 min        0.0  2796.0    0.0  Downloading  archlinux-2022.04.05-x86_64.iso

### Selecting torrents
RPCs like `--remove` and `--stop` require a torrent to be specified with `--torrent <ID>`, where `<ID>` refers to a torrent ID in the output of the `--list` RPC. Here's an example of pausing, resuming, and removing a torrent.
```
> transmission-remote --list
    ID   Done       Have  ETA           Up    Down  Ratio  Status       Name

### Everything else
For all other RPCs, see the [RPC Specification](rpc-spec.md) page. For more daemon options, see `transmission-daemon`'s man page. For instructions on autostart, i.e. system integration, see your distro's documentation. For most linux distributions, you'll probably want to see systemd's documentation.
