        <h1>Can I add and remove trackers in my torrents?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Yes. To add trackers to a currently running torrent, go to Inspector &rarr; Tracker, and click the plus button (+). To remove them, click minus button (-). Multiple trackers can also be added to torrent files you create. Each newly-added tracker will be placed in a new tier.

    <div class="pagetitle">
        <h1>What is 'Tier 1', 'Tier 2', etc?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Transmission supports multitracker torrents. All of a given torrent's trackers are divided into 'Tiers'. A tracker from each tier will be contacted simultaneously. Transmission randomly chooses a tracker from each tier until it finds one that works.
    <p>
    <div class="pagetitle">
        <h1>What does 'announce' mean?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>When Transmission <em>announces</em>, it is updating its presence to the tracker and asking for more peers. This happens periodically, at the discretion of the tracker, however can be manually invoked via Transfers menu &rarr; Update Tracker.
    <p>
    <div class="pagetitle">
        <h1>What does 'scrape' mean?</h1>
    </div>
    <p><em>Scraping</em> the tracker simply means asking for information about the swarm itself. For example, the number of peers, seeds etc.
